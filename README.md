# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a simple etch-a-sketch prototype which generates a fixed color on mouse-enter into a generated grid. In order to reset
the grid, you have to press cancel on the prompt. This is a bug that needs to be fixed, in addition to the fixed height and width issues, as when you input, say 64, the height expands but the width stays the same. Furthermore, I would like to add a randomized color generator so the color changes when you enter into a new grid square.
